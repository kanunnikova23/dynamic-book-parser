# dynamic-book-parser
This project is designed to dynamically parse a book into a text file, covering pages from the first to the last one.

After parsing the book, book is converted into .mobi file format to be able to be used by Kindle books.

The script handles each page individually, ensuring efficient and organized processing.

Key features include the ability to dynamically change the page name and use context managers to handle file operations seamlessly.
